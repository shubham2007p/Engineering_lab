Simulations of real-world physical systems with control theory, dynamics, and machine learning. A home for engineering experiments, models, and intelligent controllers.

Engineering Simulations & Intelligent Control Systems

A collection of physics-based engineering problems solved using simulation, control theory, and machine learning.

🚀 Overview

This repository is a growing collection of projects that combine:

Applied Physics

Dynamic System Modelling

Control Engineering

Machine Learning / Neural Controllers

Numerical Simulation (RK4, ODE solving)

Interactive Visualizations & Animations

Each project in this repository takes a real-world engineering scenario, builds a mathematical model, designs a controller, and optionally uses ML to improve or automate tuning.

This is a personal research playground for exploring how intelligent algorithms can interact with physical systems.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

Build intuition about real-world dynamics (pendulums, robots, actuators, etc.)

Model systems using classical physics and nonlinear equations

Explore control strategies (PD, PID, LQR, MPC, input shaping)

Train neural networks to auto-tune or approximate controllers

Create visual animations to explain how these systems behave

Prepare a foundation for future robotics, control, and AI engineering

📘 What You Will Find Inside

Each project folder typically includes:

Problem Description

Physics Model (ODEs, constraints, forces)

Controller Design (PD, PID, LQR, optimal control)

Machine Learning Enhancements (NN gain tuning, policy learning, regression models)

Simulation Code (usually Python, PyTorch, NumPy)

Plots & Animations showing system behavior

Results & Analysis

A focused README explaining the theory + implementation

New projects are continuously added as I explore different engineering domains.

🧪 Types of Projects Planned

This repo may include simulations such as:

Pendulum systems (single, double, rotary)

Crane & hoist swing control

Drone attitude stabilization

Inverted pendulums & cart-pole

Robotic arm joint dynamics

Spring-mass-damper systems

Vehicle & steering dynamics

Flow-based or heat-based physics problems

ML-powered controllers for nonlinear systems

Each one aims to show how math + code + intelligent control come together to solve real engineering challenges.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

NumPy / SciPy

PyTorch (for ML-based controllers)

Matplotlib (plots & animations)

RK4 / Euler / custom ODE solvers

Jupyter Notebooks (visual demos)
